                A brief about my former work experience: At Cognizant, my usual workload involved networking, system maintenance, database management and technical writing/documentation. I have trained and onboarded new team members.I also had the opportunity to manage teammates as a pod lead, all of which gave me crucial insights into the necessity of individual self driven efforts. 
<br><br>
My time at Cognizant taught me a great deal about what it takes to work in a team that is being built from the ground up. During my tenure there I was positioned in a team that required the work to have constant around the clock attention at some level. As a result of this I often found myself on call to triage tickets which were assigned to our team's queue as well as to immediately act on the ones that had a higher priority. 
<br><br>
As a part of my role, I had to triage tickets between the team as well as classifying whether or not a ticket is within the scope of our team and triage them to the required teams if not. At any given point I usually had around 40 active tickets which I worked on simultaneously.These tickets peratined to simple simple system issues, access to applications through AD and LDAP as well as updates to the github repositories. I was also involved in backing up and deploying new files to EC2 servers as and when required. Additionally,I would also have to query data from a DB for multiple purposes.I was involved with Jira project creation as well as confluence and sharepoint moderation along with JIRA project automation which was often done though clickpos. 
<br><br>
In case of Incidents with legitimate bugs, I would have to work closely with the developers on the documentation and the resolution of the ticket as well as corresponding with the client side personnel and any 3rd party vendors if required, providing all parties with updates on the situation as seen fit.
